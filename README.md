# Affinity Diagram Tool

Create affinity diagrams to speed up the process of assigning story points to user stories.

## Motivation

Having participated in a bunch of long and pointless meetings using `Planning Poker`
for scoring individual stories, I've found out about affinity diagrams as a method
of assigning story points to a bunch of issues. IMHO it puts complexity of issues
in perspective much better than planning poker method.

## Prerequisites
